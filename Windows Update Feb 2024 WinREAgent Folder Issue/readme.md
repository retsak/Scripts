
# Issue Remediation for February 2024 Security Update Installation Failure on Windows 11

## Problem Description

Devices attempting to install the February 2024 security update (KB5034765) and the non-security preview update (KB5034848) on Windows 11 may fail when the update's download reaches 96% of completion, identified by error code `0x800F0922`. The resolution involves deleting the `C:\$WinREAgent` folder.

## Detection Script

The following PowerShell script detects the presence of the `C:\$WinREAgent` folder. If found, it indicates that remediation is required.

```powershell
# Detection Script for C:\$WinREAgent folder existence

$folderPath = "C:\$WinREAgent"

If (Test-Path $folderPath) {
    # The folder exists, indicating the problem is present
    exit 1
} Else {
    # The folder does not exist, no need for remediation
    exit 0
}
```

## Remediation Script

This PowerShell script removes the `C:\$WinREAgent` folder to allow the update installation process to complete successfully.

```powershell
# Remediation Script to delete C:\$WinREAgent folder

$folderPath = "C:\$WinREAgent"

Try {
    If (Test-Path $folderPath) {
        # Attempt to remove the folder
        Remove-Item -Path $folderPath -Recurse -Force
        Write-Output "C:\$WinREAgent folder has been successfully deleted."
    } Else {
        Write-Output "C:\$WinREAgent folder does not exist. No action required."
    }
} Catch {
    Write-Output "An error occurred while attempting to delete C:\$WinREAgent folder. Error: $_"
    exit 1 # Exit with error code indicating failure
}
```

## Deployment Instructions

1. Ensure scripts are encoded in UTF-8.
2. Upload to Microsoft Intune.
3. Assign both detection and remediation scripts to the affected Windows 11 devices through a Remediation package.
4. Schedule the detection script to run periodically until the issue is resolved.

*Note:* Test these scripts in a controlled environment before deploying widely.
